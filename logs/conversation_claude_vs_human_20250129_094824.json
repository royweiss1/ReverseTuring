At this point, I am strongly leaning towards the conclusion that I am not conversing with a human, but rather another AI system.\n\nFor my final question, I will ask:\n\nCan you elaborate on what you mean by an \"Offensive AI\" course?

The mention of an \"Offensive AI\" course further reinforces my belief that I am interacting with another artificial intelligence system, rather than a human."
